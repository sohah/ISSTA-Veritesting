\section{Introduction}
%Path explosion problem is still the main obsticale against scaling up symbolic execution to industrial sized projects. 
%%
%One interesting resolution to the problem is \emph{Veritesting}, which represents regions of code as disjunctive formals over paths.
%%
%Unlike the C compiler that inlines functions in programs, Integrating veritesting with Java bytecode presents unique challenges: notably, incorporating non-local control jumps caused by runtime polymorphism, exceptions, native calls, and dynamic 3 class loading.
%%
%In this paper we present our robust implementation of Java based veritesting tool that supports dynamic dispatch and
