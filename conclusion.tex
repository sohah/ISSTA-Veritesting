\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

\soha{we need something for the conclusion}
There are five main directions for future work we intend to do:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support Multiple Return Regions:  Here we want to support regions with multiple returns. 
%
We want to do this by supporting another transformation that would take a multiple return region and turns it into a single return region. 

\item Support of Test Case Generation: while statically summarizing regions gives dynamic symbolic execution a performance boost to explore more paths efficiently, generating test cases that covers all summarized branches is one of the fundamental roles of dynamic symbolic execution that is currently unsupported. 
%
This is one of the extension that we intend to investigate in our future work. 
%

\item Heuristics for Instantiation: as shown in the experiments section, instantiating regions might not always be the best option in terms of performance.
%
For instance, region instantiation could in fact turn concrete values into symbolic values thus increasing the number of explored paths. 
%
This is particularly problematic if that happened for a small region on an early branch point, and the symbolic variable is later used in multiple conditions.
%
This calls for a study of the best heuristics that would provide a decision procedure as to when instantiation a region.

\item Using Incremental Solver: this seems intuitive for two main reasons: firstly because as we go down one path the query sent to the solver is incrementally defined for every branch and yet it is repeatedly being sent to the solver. 
%
And secondly because using Java Ranger tend to have relatively complex formulas to solve due to summarization. 
%
Supporting incremental solver is one direction for our future work. 
\end{itemize}



Other improvements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplification of the Symbolic PathFinder constraint mechanism

\item Interpolation-based path subsumption checks  (c.f.: "More Effective Interpolations in Software Model Checking" - ASE 2017")

\end{enumerate}
