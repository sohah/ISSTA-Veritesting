\section{Conclusion}

\mike{Future work: }

Extensions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplification of static regions at instantiation time using constant propagation, code specialization, etc.

\item Adding support for parallel Java programs with static regions

\item Adaptation of metric-based test-case generation for static regions: statement, branch, MCDC, observable metrics.

\item Parallelization of the analysis process (similar to Staats work in 2011)

\item Adding support for bypass of complex expressions: {\em symcrete} execution involving regions.

\item Integration with the Green constraint solver

\end{enumerate}

Other improvements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplification of the Symbolic PathFinder constraint mechanism

\item Interpolation-based path subsumption checks  (c.f.: "More Effective Interpolations in Software Model Checking" - ASE 2017")

\end{enumerate}
