\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:future}

We presented Java Ranger as a path merging tool for Java.
%
It works by systematically applying a series of transformations over a statement recovered from the CFG. This
representation provides the benefit of modularity and makes path-merging for Java symbolic execution more accessible to
end users.
%
Java Ranger has its own IR statement and it supports the construction of SSA for fields and arrays.
%
Java Ranger provides evidence that inlining summaries of higher-order regions can lead to a further reduction in the
number of execution paths that need to be explored with path merging.
%
It supports the exploration of exceptional behavior in multi-path regions via Single Path Cases.
%
It provides an alternative method using which a symbolic executor can summarize unexceptional behavior of a multi-path
region while simultaneously capturing exceptional behavior in the region.
%
Java Ranger reinterprets path merging for symbolic execution of Java bytecode and has the potential to allow symbolic
execution to scale up to exploration of real-world Java programs.
