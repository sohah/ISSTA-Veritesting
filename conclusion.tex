\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:future}

We presented an extension to veritesting implemented in a tool named \tool.
%
It works by systematically applying a series of transformations over a statement recovered from the CFG.
%
%This representation provides the benefit of modularity and makes path-merging for Java symbolic execution more accessible to
%end users.
%
%Java Ranger has its own IR statement and it supports the construction of SSA for fields and arrays.
%
\tool\rq s use of fixed-point computation over multiple transformations demonstrates a
significant improvement over SPF.
%
\tool\ provides evidence that inlining summaries of higher-order regions can lead to a further reduction in the
number of execution paths that need to be explored with path merging as shown by the TCAS benchmark.
%
\tool\rq s use of return value summaries also demonstrates a significant benefit over SPF with the NanoXML benchmark.
%
%It supports the exploration of exceptional behavior in multi-path regions via Single Path Cases.
%
%It provides an alternative method using which a symbolic executor can summarize unexceptional behavior of a multi-path
%region while simultaneously capturing exceptional behavior in the region.
%
\tool\ reinterprets path merging for symbolic execution of Java bytecode and allows symbolic
execution to scale to exploration of real-world Java programs.
