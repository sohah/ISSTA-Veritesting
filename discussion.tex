\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}
While \tool\ was able to significantly outperform SPF in a majority of our benchmarks, there are a few directions
along which it can further be extended.
%
Java Ranger attempts to perform path merging as aggresively as possible.
%
This path merging strategy doesn't optimize towards making fewer solver calls.
%
We plan to work towards implementing heuristics that can measure the effect of path merging on the rest of the program.
    
While statically summarizing regions gives dynamic symbolic execution a performance boost to explore more paths
efficiently, generating test cases that covers all summarized branches is one of the most useful applications of dynamic
symbolic execution that is currently unsupported.
%
We intend to extend \tool\ towards test generation for merged paths in the future.

While path merging can potentially allow symbolic execution to explore interesting parts of a program sooner, the
effect of path merging on search strategies, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search commonly used with
symbolic execution, remains to be investigated.
%
We plan to explore the integration of such guidance heuristics with path merging in the future.
%
Java Ranger can summarize methods and regions in Java standard libraries.
%
This creates potential for automatically constructing summaries of standard libraries so that symbolic execution
can prevent path explosion originating from standard libraries.
