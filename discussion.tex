\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}
While \tool\ was able to significantly outperform SPF in a majority of our benchmarks, there are a few directions
along which it can further be extended.
%
Java Ranger attempts to perform path merging as aggressively as possible.
%
This path merging strategy doesn't optimize towards making fewer solver calls.
%
We plan to work towards implementing heuristics that can measure the effect of path merging on the rest of the program.
%
\tool\ currently lacks support for symbolic object and array references.
%
Supporting these would require integrating our implementation with
SPF\rq s lazy initialization~\cite{spf} to allow symbolic object references to be part of a region.

While path-merging gives dynamic symbolic execution a performance boost to explore more paths
efficiently, generating test cases that cover all branches is one of the most useful applications of dynamic
symbolic execution.
%
This is an example of an application of symbolic execution that, if applied as-is, would have to undo the benefits of
path-merging.
%
We intend to extend \tool\ towards test generation for merged paths in the future by targeting test generation
towards a coverage criterion such as Modified Condition/Decision Coverage.

While path merging can potentially allow symbolic execution to explore interesting parts of a program sooner, the
effect of path merging on search strategies, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search commonly used with
symbolic execution, remains to be investigated.
%
We plan to explore the integration of such guidance heuristics with path merging in the future.
%
Java Ranger can summarize methods and regions in Java standard libraries.
%
This creates potential for automatically constructing summaries of standard libraries so that symbolic execution
can prevent path explosion originating from standard libraries.
