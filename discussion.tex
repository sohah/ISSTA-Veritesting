\begin{itemize}

\item Small regions cause performance problems, especially when they make previously concrete information symbolic.
This can lead to many more solver calls, even when the number of paths is reduced.
    
\item In some models, it is possible to reduce the number of paths to one.  The static region approach essentially
constructs a unrolled version of the program, similar to what tools like CBMC construct.   This can only happen on
relatively static models that do not have a lot of object construction leading to multiple dispatch paths.  HOSRs are
more flexible for these situations and allow specialization depending on dispatch type, which we believe will lead to
better performance for highly-dynamic models.
    
\item In general, the solver time does not rise dramatically for disjunctive paths. Since (in the limit) we reduce the
number of paths exponentially by removing branches, we can perform relatively expensive analyses as preprocessing steps
and at instantiation if we are able to instantiate a static region, and still end up with much better performance.

\item Talk about the need to have incremental solving or other optimizations to region summaries that can reduce formula
complexity and make fewer solver calls
    
\item Talk about predicting the number of execution paths in regions so that our constructed region summaries can be
used by other symbolic executors with a knowledge of how much path reduction is being performed by the summary for a
given number of symbolic inputs
